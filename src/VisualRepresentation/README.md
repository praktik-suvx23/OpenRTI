# üì° ReceiveData - 3D Data Visualization in Python

## üîç Check if Python is installed
Run this command to see if Python is available:

```bash
python3 --version
```

If it's not installed, you can install it with:

```bash
sudo apt install python3
```

## üì¶ Install the required Python libraries
Use the following command to install the required libraries:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-matplotlib python3-numpy python3-scipy
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Program
While in the folder containing the script, run:

```bash
python3 ReceiveData.py
```

## ReceiveData.py

The `ReceiveData.py` script is a core component of the data visualization pipeline. It is responsible for receiving, processing, and preparing data for visualization or further analysis. This script ensures that incoming data is handled efficiently and reliably, making it suitable for real-time or high-volume data scenarios.

### Key Features
- **Data Reception**: Listens for and receives data from a specified source, such as a network socket, file, or API.
- **Data Validation**: Parses and validates the received data to ensure it adheres to expected formats or criteria.
- **Error Handling**: Implements mechanisms to manage errors or exceptions during the data reception process.
- **Output Preparation**: Processes the data and makes it available for downstream tasks, such as visualization or storage.

This script is ideal for applications requiring robust data handling, such as real-time monitoring, data logging, or communication systems.

## SendData.cpp

The `SendData.cpp` script is a critical component of the data transmission pipeline. It is responsible for sending data to a specified destination, ensuring reliable and efficient communication. This script is designed to handle various data formats and transmission protocols, making it versatile for different use cases.

### Key Features
- **Data Transmission**: Sends data to a specified target, such as a network socket, file, or API endpoint.
- **Protocol Support**: Supports multiple communication protocols to ensure compatibility with diverse systems.
- **Error Handling**: Implements mechanisms to detect and recover from transmission errors or interruptions.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimized for high-speed and low-latency data transmission, suitable for real-time applications.

This script is ideal for scenarios requiring reliable and efficient data delivery, such as distributed systems, IoT devices, or data streaming applications.

## SerializeData.cpp

The `SerializeData.cpp` script is an essential utility for preparing data for storage or transmission. It is responsible for converting complex data structures into a format that can be easily stored or transmitted and later reconstructed. This script ensures data integrity and compatibility across different systems.

### Key Features
- **Data Serialization**: Converts data structures into a serialized format, such as JSON, XML, or binary.
- **Data Deserialization**: Reconstructs serialized data back into its original structure for further use.
- **Format Flexibility**: Supports multiple serialization formats to meet diverse application requirements.
- **Error Handling**: Includes mechanisms to handle serialization or deserialization errors gracefully.

This script is ideal for applications requiring data exchange between heterogeneous systems, persistent storage, or efficient data transmission.
