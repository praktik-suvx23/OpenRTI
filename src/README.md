# OpenRTI Project

## Overview

This project is an implementation of the OpenRTI (Run-Time Infrastructure) for distributed simulations. It allows multiple simulation applications, known as federates, to communicate and coordinate their actions in a shared simulation environment called a federation.

## Project Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/praktik-suvx23/OpenRTI.git
    cd OpenRTI
    ```

2. **Build the Project**
    Ensure you have the necessary build tools and dependencies installed. Then, run the following commands:
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    make install
    ```
3. **Run the RTI**
    To start your federate, use the following command in the build directory:
    ```bash
    rtinode
    ```

4. **Run the PublisherFederate**
    To start your federate, use the following command in a new terminal in the build directory:
    ```bash
    ./MyPublisher
    ```
5. **Run the ShipPublisherFederate**
    To start your federate, use the following command in a new terminal in the build directory:
    ```bash
    ./MyShip
    ```
6. **Run the subscriber**
    To start your federate, use the following command in a new terminal in the build directory:
    ```bash
    ./MyFederate
    ```

## How It Works

### Federate

A federate is a simulation application that interacts with other federates in a federation. Each federate must join a federation to participate in the simulation.

### Federation

A federation is a collection of federates that share a common simulation environment. The federation is managed by the RTI, which handles communication and coordination between federates.

After installing the project you may try and use:
```
rtinode -c /usr/OjOpenRTI/OpenRTI/configs/rtinode_config.xml
```
This command starts the RTI (Run-Time Infrastructure) using the configuration file rtinode_config.xml. 
In the config file you can change server options and more for the RTI

Explanation:

    The rtinode process acts as the central RTI instance that federates connect to. It's like a server waiting for client connections.
    If it's running without error messages, itâ€™s in standby mode, ready to accept connections from federates.

When the `rtinode` is running you may use:
```
sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep rtinode
```
to find what ports it's using. Since it's a OpenRTI project it's *most likely* **14321**.


### TIPS
If you find OpenRTI's repository hard to understand, you may look at [Portico](https://github.com/openlvc/portico). They have some C++ example code that can be somewhat translated to OpenRTI. And if nothing else, you may see in their example how a ```.xml``` file could look like.
